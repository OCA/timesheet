This module was written to extend the Timesheet capabilities of Odoo.

It allows to restrict the access to the products that represent an actual
employee, only to the Human Resources / Manager group.

A company may want to record an actual hourly cost per employee, so that the
time entered by employees through timesheets can result in a more realistic
cost, but at the same time want to conceal this information to general
employees.
