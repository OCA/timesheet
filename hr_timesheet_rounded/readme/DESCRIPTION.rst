Round timesheet lines quantity based on project' settings.

A typical use case is: you work 5 minutes but you want to invoice 15 minutes.

With this module you can configure a rounding factor on the project
and all the lines tracked on this project's tasks will show a rounded amount.

If you want you can override the value manually on each entry.

The delivered quantity on the sale order line
- and by consequence on the invoice - will be computed using the rounded amount.

Expense lines and other non-timesheet lines won't be affected.
