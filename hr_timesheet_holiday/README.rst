===============================
Link holidays to analytic lines
===============================

This module adds a relation between Leave Type and Analytic Account.
When a Leave Request is granted, the granted days are converted to hours and
added as a line to the Analytic Account.

When the leave is revoked, the analytic lines are removed again.

The analytic lines are read-only, so you cannot edit them directly, just by
granting or revoking leave requests.

The hours to input per day is configurable at company level.

Limitations:

- Consider that the work days are Monday to Friday

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Find your company in Settings - Companies and configure the amount of hours
   per workday under Configuration - Timesheets - Timesheet Hours Per Day.
#. For each Leave Type under Human Resources - Leave Types, select or create
   an Analytic Account.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Approve a Leave Request
#. See the hours added to Timesheet Activities
#. Revoke a Leave Request
#. See the hours removed from Timesheet Activities

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Hours per workday should be configurable per employee, not only by company.
  To make this easier, the function `_get_hours_per_day` was made which can be
  overridden by child modules.
* We should probably start using resource calendars.
* hr_timesheet_sheet dependency can be changed to hr_timesheet, now only
  included because hr_timesheet_sheet adds the Timesheet configurations menu
  in Company view.
