This module evaluates a specific quality requirement related to
Timesheet Sheets (Imputed hours on public holiday).
In particular, it provides information about whether an employee
has imputed hours on a public holiday during the specified
sheet period (for each sheet individually). This requirement is later
available in the class as a boolean field.

With this information, Timesheet Sheet submitters and reviewers can
gain insight into the accuracy of imputed hours on public holidays.
It allows them to assess whether the recorded information in the sheets aligns
correctly with the company's policies and expectations.
