This module supplies a new screen enabling you to manage your work encoding (timesheet) by period.
Timesheet entries are made by employees each day. At the end of the defined period,
employees validate their sheet and the manager must then approve his team's entries.
Periods are defined in the company forms and you can set them to run monthly, weekly or daily.

Negative hours are not admitted.
