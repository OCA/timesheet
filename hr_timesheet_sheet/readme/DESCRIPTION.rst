This module supplies a new screen enabling you to manage your work encoding
(timesheet) by period. Timesheet entries are made by employees each day. At the
end of the defined period, employees submit their validated sheet and the
reviewer must then approve submitted entries. Periods are defined in the
company forms and you can set them to run monthly, weekly or daily. By default,
policy is configured to have HR Officer/Manager as reviewer.
