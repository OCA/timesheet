==================
HR Timesheet Sheet
==================

This module supplies a new screen enabling you to manage your work encoding (timesheet) by period.
Timesheet entries are made by employees each day. At the end of the defined period,
employees validate their sheet and the manager must then approve his team's entries.
Periods are defined in the company forms and you can set them to run monthly, weekly or daily.

Negative hours are not admitted.

Installation
============

This module relies on:

* The OCA module '2D matrix for x2many fields', and can be downloaded from
  Github: https://github.com/OCA/web/tree/11.0/web_widget_x2many_2d_matrix


Configuration
=============

If you want other default ranges different from weekly, you need to go:

* In the menu `Configuration` -> `Settings` -> **Timesheet Options**,
  and select in **Timesheet Sheet Range** the default range you want.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* When you open the `Summary` or `Details` tab, a save should be performed
  to ensure the data shown is correct. This perhaps could be achieved by including
  a .js file that does that.
* The timesheet grid is limited to display a max. of 1M cells, due to a
  limitation of the tree view limit parameter not being able to dynamically
  set a limit. Since default value of odoo, 40 records is too small, we decided
  to set 1M, which should be good enough in the majority of scenarios.
