This module supplies a new screen enabling you to manage your work encoding
(timesheet) by period. Timesheet entries are made by employees each day. At the
end of the defined period, employees submit their validated sheet and the
reviewer must then approve submitted entries. Periods are defined in the
company forms and you can set them to run monthly, weekly or daily. By default,
policy is configured to have HR Officer/Manager as reviewer.

Installation
============

This module relies on:

* The OCA module '2D matrix for x2many fields', and can be downloaded from
  Github: https://github.com/OCA/web/tree/11.0/web_widget_x2many_2d_matrix

Configuration
=============

If you want other default ranges different from weekly, you need to go:

* In the menu `Configuration` -> `Settings` -> **Timesheet Options**,
  and select in **Timesheet Sheet Range** the default range you want.
* When you have a weekly range you can also specify the **Week Start Day**.

To change who reviews submitted sheets, go to *Configuration > Settings > Timesheet Options*
and configure **Timesheet Sheet Review Policy** accordingly.

Usage
=====

If you modify the `Details` tab, automatically the `Summary` tab is updated.
But if you modify the `Summary` tab, you need to save in order to have the `Details` tab updated.

In case you modify the unit amount of both tabs, the `Details` tab will prevail.
If you modify the `Summary` tab, and you need to do a change in the `Details` tab, please save before.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* The timesheet grid is limited to display a max. of 1M cells, due to a
  limitation of the tree view limit parameter not being able to dynamically
  set a limit. Since default value of odoo, 40 records is too small, we decided
  to set 1M, which should be good enough in the majority of scenarios.
