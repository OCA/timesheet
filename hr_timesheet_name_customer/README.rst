This module adds additional field "Description Customer" which is used for customer timesheet reports.
This might be useful if you need to translate original timesheet description or add some additional information into it while leaving original description intact.
This field is visible only for "Timesheets: Administrator" group.

By default this field will be populated from the "Description" field of the timesheet.

New report "Timesheet Customer" is used to print timesheets with "Customer Description" instead of the "Description" field.
