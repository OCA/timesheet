This module provides functionality for defining custom warning criteria related to
Timesheet Sheets using Python expressions. Users can establish specific conditions
for evaluating certain aspects of the Sheets.
Once the warnings are defined, the module facilitates a systematic evaluation of
Timesheet Sheets against these conditions. It generates individual warnings for each
Sheet, if the warnings criteria are met.
