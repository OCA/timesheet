This module provides functionality for defining custom warning criteria related to
Timesheet Sheets using Python expressions. Users can establish specific conditions
for evaluating certain aspects of the Sheets.
Once the warnings are defined, the module facilitates a systematic evaluation of
Timesheet Sheets against these conditions. It generates individual warnings for each
Sheet, if the warnings criteria are met.

Installation
============

This module relies on:

* The OCA module '2D matrix for x2many fields', and can be downloaded from
  Github: https://github.com/OCA/web/tree/16.0/web_widget_x2many_2d_matrix

Usage
=====

In order to create warning definitions for Timesheet Sheets, you need to go:

* In the menu `Configuration` -> **Warnings**,
  and start creating a new instance of a warning definition.
* Once inside, you will be able to specify the domain of the warning (the Timesheet
  Sheets it will be checked against) and the warning expression (the Python code
  that will be run and, if it evaluates to true, will indicate that a warning
  should be raised for that specific Sheet), amongst other fields.

To run those checks and raise the necessary warnings for a specific Timesheet
Sheet, you need to go:

* When looking at a Timesheet Sheet, go to the 'Warnings' tab.
* There you can press the button 'Generate Warnings', and you will be able to
  see the generated warnings in the list below the button.
* Warnings are also automatically generated when a Timesheet Sheet is
  submitted to the reviewer.
