This module allows to update Sale order item in a task, without updating the related
Sale order item for all the existing timesheets in that task.


Use case: a new "timesheet hours" line is added to SO related to project, but hours on
the previous SO line have not been billed yet.


This module allows to add new timesheet lines related to the newer SOL Item, while
keeping the previously inputted hours related to the previous SOL item.
