Round timesheet lines amounts in sales based on project' settings.

A typical use case is: you work 5 minutes but you want to invoice 15 minutes.

With this module you can configure a rounding unit or factor on the project
and all the lines tracked on this project's tasks will show a rounded amount.

If you want you can override the value manually on each entry.

The delivered quantity on the sale order line - and by consequence on the
invoice - will be computed using the rounded amount.
Therefore, expense lines and other non-timesheet lines will be updated with
a rounded amount that is equal to the amount.

WARNING: This module cannot be used with `timesheet_grid` without further
adapation as an update of an existing timesheet line will NOT update the
rounded amount. To achieve this, you need to override `adjust_grid` function
to pass the `force_compute` context key.

Configuration
=============

Go to a project and set the following fields according to your needs:


* Timesheet rounding unit

Defines the rounding unit.
For instance, if you want to round to 1 hour, you can set `1.0`.
If you want to round to 15 min set `0.25`.


* Timesheet rounding method

Options: "No" (default), "Closest", "Up", "Down".

Please refer to `odoo.tools.float_utils.float_round` to understand the difference.


* Timesheet rounding factor (percentage)

When round unit is not defined you can round by a fixed %.


When using both a unit and a factor, the factor will be applied first:

  result = round(amount * percentage, unit)

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* improve test coverage
