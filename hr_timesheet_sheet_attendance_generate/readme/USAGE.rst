By activating the `Generate Attendances` button in a timesheet sheet (which
can be found next to the `Submit to Reviewer` button for timesheet sheets in
draft state), the corresponding attendances will be created and later
displayed in the screen using a wizard.

There, the user will be able to remove any created attendance that they do
not want to be kept in the database. After that, by activating the `Save`
button only the attendances that were accepted by the user will be persisted
in the system.
