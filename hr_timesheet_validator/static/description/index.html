            <p>
            This module was written to extend the HR Timesheet capabilities of Odoo.

            Timesheets in Odoo can be validated by users belonging to the group
            “Human Resources / Officer”.

            However it is frequent for companies allow to employees outside of the
            Human Resources group to validate timesheet.

            This module allows a user outside of the Human Resources groups to validate
            timesheets. A rule is predefined, but it is flexible enough to accept
            extensions.

            At the time when a user submits a timesheet to the Manager, the application
            determines the validators.

            Only those validators or employees in the group of Human Resources Officer
            are capable of approving the timesheet.

            The current rule sets as validators of a timesheet:

            - The head of the department that the employee belongs to

            In case that the employee is head of the department, it will attempt to add
            the head of the parent department instead.

            - The employee’s direct manager

            The list of validators is visible in the employee’s timesheet.
