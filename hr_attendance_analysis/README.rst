HR - Attendance Analysis
========================

Dynamic reports based on employee's attendances and contract's calendar.
Among other things, it lets you see the amount of working hours outside and
inside the contract's working schedule (overtime).
It also provides a daily based report, showing the detailed and total hours
compared to calendar hours.
Several analysis settings can be configured, like:

* Tolerance for sign-in and sign-out
* Attendances and overtimes roundings
* Diffrent types of overtime, according to the overtime amount
